# tuned/release.sh <variant> — run the release gates for the wheel tuned/package.sh made. Stage order:
#   build.sh -> full_test.sh -> package.sh -> smoke_test.sh -> (review and commit tuned/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_<version>.md) -> this -> publish.sh
# It never builds, tests, packages or publishes (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md B3, I5). If every gate passes it writes the
# ready-marker (gpu_tuned_release_ready, RELEASE_READY_<variant>); tuned/publish.sh <variant> publishes exactly what
# the gates saw. The gates are the common ones in tuned-common (gpu_tuned_release_gates), all reported together.

#
# The release is named by the wheel's date label (v<version>, the version ending +<variant>.cu<cuda>.<YYYYMMDD>[.<seq>]),
# read from package-info.txt and never recomputed here: the notes commit moves HEAD and its date.
