# tuned/package.sh <variant> — package the wheel tuned/build.sh made and tuned/full_test.sh tested: stamp a
# STAGED copy of it with the JSON build info (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md H7), repack, write the sha256 sidecar,
# package-info.txt and, if no notes are tracked yet, a DRAFT release-notes file. It never builds, tests,
# tags or publishes (B3). Stage order:
#   build.sh -> full_test.sh -> package.sh -> smoke_test.sh -> (review and commit the notes) -> release.sh -> publish.sh
#
#   CUDA_TAG=cu134 bash tuned/package.sh gb10
#
# Input:  tuned/build/<cuda-tag>/wheel/vllm_flash_attn-*.whl (unstamped; never modified here, H3), release-label and
#         build-commit from wheel.sh, and the passing test log from full_test.sh.
# Output: tuned/build/<cuda-tag>/dist/{vllm_flash_attn-*.whl, vllm_flash_attn-*.whl.sha256, package-info.txt} and
#         tuned/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_<version>.md (DRAFT) when no notes exist. package-info.txt is written last
#         (H2): its presence means every check above it passed.
#
# Stamped (H7): vllm_flash_attn/_vllm_fa2_C.abi3.so, the one extension this variant builds (FA3 is a no-op target off
# Hopper). The stamp records the build inputs that shaped the binary (the allowlist ENV_RECORD below: arch spelling,
# the pinned torch the extension links against, the vendored tuned-common commit), never the whole environment. The
# environment itself is derived on each run and not saved.
